The packages may be used either with Plain TeX or LaTeX.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="346235">texmf\tex\generic\xint\xint.sty texmf\tex\generic\xint\xintbinhex.sty texmf\tex\generic\xint\xintcfrac.sty texmf\tex\generic\xint\xintexpr.sty texmf\tex\generic\xint\xintfrac.sty texmf\tex\generic\xint\xintgcd.sty texmf\tex\generic\xint\xintseries.sty texmf\tex\generic\xint\xinttools.sty texmf\tpm\packages\xint.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="607603">texmf\doc\generic\xint\README texmf\doc\generic\xint\xint.pdf</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="198568">texmf\source\xint-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1396900802</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>cb3905333ce0f2433a35c051ee25b911</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/generic/xint"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Jean-François Burnol" year="2013-2014"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
