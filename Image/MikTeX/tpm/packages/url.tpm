(The \urldef command provides robust commands that serve in cases when \url doesn't work in an argument.) The command is intended for email addresses, hypertext links, directories/paths, etc., which normally have no spaces, so by default the package ignores spaces in its argument. However, a package option &amp;#8220;allows spaces&amp;#8221;, which is useful for operating systems where spaces are a common part of file names.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="23587">texmf\tex\latex\url\miscdoc.sty texmf\tex\latex\url\url.sty texmf\tpm\packages\url.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="243941">texmf\doc\latex\url\url.pdf</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="5129">texmf\source\url-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1264505142</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>15eb8d7456d8c972857e8b25a8690ff4</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
